BLOG POST 1: LIBRARY OF BABEL AND GARDEN OF FORKING PATHS
</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    According to Borge in, “The Library of Babel”, a specific library is described as “infinite”, where it contains every book to ever exist, although the library is infinite and not the books. The books are meant to have meaning, regardless if it is another language, and much like the library, in this case, every page on the internet has some type of meaning, regardless if it is important or not. Borge explains that the library was expected to solve every problem in the universe, it did not, and the books are very random with different letter combinations, making each book unique. The library can be compared to an algorithm, an algorithm can be defined as rules that are used for problem-solving. The internet is very much similar to this with its algorithms and how it has its own problem-solving techniques.
</p>  
<p>
    Borge states that there are no two identical books in this library as they are all unique, with the random information that they contain. The internet is also a vast place of knowledge and contains almost everything, likewise to the library, it has unique pages that can be identified through a page’s URL. This is known as a “Uniform Resource Locator”, it is a distinctive sentence that is used as a web page’s address, there are no URLs that are the same.
</p> 
<p>
    The books in the library are very random, they consist of all the letters in a randomized way, which makes it quite hard to interpret or find a meaning in it. The internet is almost the same, where random data is produced when something is being searched for, yet it is processed and results in outcomes that can actually be understood by people, returning their searches in a sensible way.
</p> 
<p>
    “The Garden of Forking Paths”, also written by Borges, has a more detailed, underlying meaning, which does compare to certain aspects of the internet. The story does present a concept of time, considering how Yu Tsun had ended up in the exact same labyrinth that his forefather had created. The way the events had played out was proof that a certain event can happen in a multiple amount of times and have quite different outcomes. The labyrinth and book that was created by Ts’ui Pen were actually linked in a way that made sense together, where the paths are the same, different outcomes can occur.
</p> 
<p>
Just like this story, a quality of the internet does make its first appearance, the “Hypertext”, this is a way where a set of items can link to each other. In the case of the internet, a hypertext is a link to another website or web page that is very much similar to your original search. The time aspect in the story explains that time and events have certain pathways that split and come together, and can possibly be parallel to each other, very much like the hypertext. These can be never ending as well, considering the internet is almost infinite too, links can be cycles that lead you to different “pathways”, resulting in different outcomes.

        BLOG POST 2: REFLECTION OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB
    </h3>
<hr>
<p>
    The article by Tim Berners-Lee et al, explains the basic history of the internet (The World Wide Web) and its components, with how they work together. In the article, it is mentioned how the World Wide Web was initially developed to allow people from all over the world to collaborate on projects together, the example given was for physicists to collaborate with each other to build components for better physics research. Hypertext was used in a more personal way to follow the information that had been shared, therefore allowing the idea of the web to come about. 
</p>
<p>
    There are ways that make the World Wide Web easier to use between many collaborators, such as: Different ways to share data, easier ways to add the data onto the web, and even having the same user interface (therefore making it easier for users to share information and not have to learn the different interfaces). 
</p>
<p>
    The WWW can be split up into its different components, which make it up as a whole, working system. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for communication through the WWW, which has been improved significantly to HTML +. It also consists of URIs (Universal Resource Identifiers), these are address systems of objects. There is also the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) which allows the transfer of information through the WWW, as well as recovering documents. 
</p>
<p>
    It is mentioned in the article that there are also other systems that are much like the World Wide Web, such as the WAIS and Gopher have the same capabilities and client server to the WWW. The WAIS protocol has no tools for navigation, therefore not guiding a user through data and resources, it also does have a text-based search and recovery. Gopher is a web that contains loops, it also has a text-based search much like WAIS, although mainly uses menus. 
</p>
<p>
    The Gopher model and the WWW are very similar, although the WWW model has a more efficient way of communicating options in hypertext. The difference between the WAIS and the WWW is that the WAIS requires graphics and text to be associated with each other, while the WWW and Gopher include sound, video and graphics. World Wide Web users can also have access to different servers as an interface. 
</p>
<p>
    The article also contains developments to the World Wide Web, such as software upgrades that are chosen by users and why they need in specific software. It was also discovered that the availability of browsers and the quality of the information have a direct impact on each other. Information providers are also important in the sense where certain information is readily available at particular places. 
</p>
<p>
    There is always room for improvement in the WWW, where it can also be a display for information technology development. The article lists a number of web developments, such as: using the internet for profit services, easier servers for individuals to publish information, and having specific names for documents and not only their location pathways.
