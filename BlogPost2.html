        <section>
            <p>
                The website that I will be discussing is the online store for Typo. This will discuss the UX and UI design the Typo website. <br>
                <br>
                Drawing from the reading, “Interpreting the Layout of Web Pages”, written by Luis Francisco-Revilla, Jeff Crow, looking at the design of Typo, 
                it can be categorized as a modular layout. Majority of news articles and online shopping stores make use of modular layout. 
                According to Luis Francisco-Revilla and Jeff Crow, a modular website layout tends to display objects in the simplest way possible, although it is not the easiest 
                to design as it is time consuming and complex (Luis Francisco-Revilla, 2009 ). <br>
                <br>
                The way that items are represented on the Typo website, they are categorized under their different categories to make searching for a specific set of items a lot easier. 
                This also falls under modular layout because all of the information that is displayed on the Typo site are multi-column, they are positioned this way so that there can be 
                more content that is displayed on the site, also it looks more organized and buyers can compare products easily this way. Luis Francisco-Revilla and Jeff Crow also mention 
                in their document that a lot of columns can make a website look complicated with too much of information, looking unappealing, although this is not the case with Typo. 
                The colours and font make it more enticing, where I can spend hours searching through the items and sale items. <br>
                <br>
                The user experience is an important concept to consider when designing a website, especially if it is a web site that is an online store. 
                According to Marc Hassenzahl & Noam Tractinsky, in “User experience - a research agenda”, mention how user experience can make something look better 
                and how it can be used to make a site easier to use for consumers (Tractinsky, 2011). In regards to the Typo site, the user experience stands out, 
                due to the fact that everything is perfectly categorised by its function, items can be filtered, there is a Wishlist, which is important because it allows a user to 
                keep track of the items they want without accidentally purchasing it. The site gives the user a good experience.<br>
                <br>
                As mentioned in the Kidd reading, “Representation”, there are advertisements everywhere we look. Kidd refers to this as persuasion (Kidd, 2016). 
                Kidd continues to discuss how advertisements are in our everyday life and how they influence what we buy. Online stores are always full of advertisements, 
                especially with advertising the right products to a specific target market. With the Typo site, there are a lot of adverts that relate to stationery and other items that 
                Typo stocks. This allows the user to engage and consider items that are being advertised, therefore these ads persuade the buyers into buying more items that are 
                similar to their previous purchases. Virtually, every website that users visit, they are loaded with advertisements, especially from their recent search and purchase history, 
                this is a smart way to rope in more customers to your site.<br>
