                Understanding the works of Li, Revilla and Crow and Knaflic can help in creating a website that will be easily accessible and understandable for readers, as well as the data 
                that is portrayed on the site.<br>
                <br> 
                Li discusses data visualization and the relation between data visualization and aesthetics. Aesthetics are important when designing a website, especially when it includes data 
                visualization. Data sets need to be designed in a way where the data is easily understandable to the user, while still maintaining an aesthetic appeal to them. 
                Aesthetics become important in data visualization because it can draw attention to certain data sets that need to be emphasized, as well as keeping the reader interested and 
                wanting to explore the data. <br> 
                <br>
                Luis Francisco-Revilla and Jeff Crow discuss modular layouts in web design. This particular design can be classified as a simplistic, yet time consuming layout. 
                It displays information and images in a way that easier for the viewers to read and scroll through, while also being organized with the data that is being portrayed on the site.<br>
                <br> 
                Knaflic discusses actual data sets that are being visualized and how effective they are in being able to communicate the data, as well as their efficiency. 
                This is important because readers need to understand the data that they are reading, and be able to still process what it is. Knaflic discusses that visualizations like graphs 
                need to display the data efficiently, such as having clearly marked axis and accurate graphs.<br>
                <br> 
                For my data driven artwork, I decided to keep it very simple, due to my lack of time and coding knowledge. As my first idea, I would have liked to have different circles on the 
                page, these would look like solar flares. When the user would hover on these images, they would change to reveal data about different flares and information on these flares. 
                This would include data directly from the API, but considering that I chose a challenging API, I had decided to use easier data from it and manually add it in. 
                I had a bit of trouble implementing these images, so I decided to go with my second idea. I took different images of solar flares, these change to text information about solar 
                flares. They are regular, square shaped images. <br>
                <br>
                My representation and communication strategies make use of images, this keeps the user interested with a visual aid, while still communicating relevant information about a s
                pecific data set from the API. The emotion in this data driven artwork should be considered as interest, due to the fact that my entire website communicates interesting 
                information, compared to be informative websites that actually contain useful information. <br>
                <br>
                The aesthetics of this particular artwork tie in with the rest of my website, as it is about space and the API gathers data from NASA about solar flares. It keeps the reader 
                drawn, due to the constant portrayal of space throughout the entire site. The text that shows up when the user hovers over an image is informative, for interest sake. 
                The entire data set describes active region numbers, what they are and why they could be important. I added a link to the official NASA website, this is an explanation of 
                active region numbers. Making use of Luis Francisco-Revilla and Jeff Crow’s research, I had decided to make this data driven artwork a linear, very modular layout. 
                It is a simple layout of the data, while still being aesthetic and informative. I also decided to follow Li’s data visualization research, to try and find creative methods to 
                portray data values that can be informative and keep readers interested. <br>
                <br>
                The point of the data set was to be interesting for users, while still portraying interesting information about the API data that is being used. I thought it would be important 
                to understand what an active region number is and how it can be detrimental for NASA to keep track of it. Although a lot of the numbers and data may not necessarily mean much to 
                someone who does not work at NASA, it can be fascinating to know about things that are happening beyond our planet. <br>
                <br>
                Personally, I believe that I can do better on the data driven artwork, I would have liked to have spent more time on it, making it more interactive and aesthetic. 
                This could have been achieved by adding more interactive elements to the site for the users to interact with, and these doing different things, and portraying different 
                information. <br>
                <br>
                The meaning that I would have liked to create through my data set and interactive work would have been that, even though there are certain data sets that don’t 
                necessarily matter to a 
                person’s everyday life, it can be interesting to know about it. As humans, we are so caught up in our everyday life, as well as only being interested on what’s happening in 
                other people’s lives, we tend to forget that there is a whole universe surrounding us. No matter what, big or little changes in the universe, it is still good to know about it,
                because it can begin to help us understand the universe, a small bit at a time, even through its vast mysteries.
