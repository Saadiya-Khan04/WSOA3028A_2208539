            <h2>Blog Post 3: Design, UI and UX of My Website</h2>
            <hr>

        <section>
            <p>
                In this Blog Post I will be discussing the UI, UX and Design of my own, personal website this semester. The UX, UI and Design of a website are very important, 
                as it determines how people interact with your website and whether or not it is a site worth exploring and going back. If a website it is good, it should have the 
                characteristics of a good user experience, allowing users to have a good experience when using your site. <br>
                <br>
                “Interpreting the Layout of Web Pages”, written by Luis Francisco-Revilla and Jeff Crow, they discuss what a modular layout is when it comes to web design. Websites that contains a 
                modular layout can often be seen as news sites and online shopping stores. Although designing sites like this are complex and time consuming, they are actually developed to be the 
                easiest way to display information and content on a site. <br>
                <br>
                Making use of these, personally, I would like to attempt to try a modular layout. There will be multiple images and content in columns, making the site simple to explore, 
                as well as giving the user a good experience. Drawing inspiration from my last website, I would like to keep a few things the same, moving forward for when I start 
                designing my new site. 
                There will be a banner that scrolls with the page, the content pages will be very similar, as well as having more visuals. These are original ideas from my last site.<br>
                <br>
                My new site will also have a different colour scheme, black, blue and purple. I chose these colours because they come to mind when I think about astronomy and space. 
                I would like to explore an automatic scrolling image gallery that will display images from the real Hubble telescope. The API that I will be using will be a NASA API, 
                specifically the Mars weather services. I chose this because we always know what the weather is like on Earth every day, it would be interesting to know what the weather 
                is like on a whole other planet. In terms of User Experience, as discussed earlier, I will be attempting to try a modular layout for my site. 
                As well as scrolling banner that will be interactable with while on any part of the page, although I have done this, it does make site navigation easier. <br>
                <br>
                In conclusion, drawing from “Theories of Representation” (Kidd, 2016), written by Jenny Kidd, it can be seen that the passage “Representation and Reality” explains the 
                semiotics of signs, codes and language and how they mean certain things. Referring to this ideology, in conjunction with my site, 
                I would like there to be a sense of narrative through the signs, graphs and visuals that are added to the site. It becomes more meaningful when there are 
                ideas of representation that actually tell a narrative, and they mean many things. <br>
