                      Being an artist is not necessarily as easy as people think. It is quite time consuming, and sometimes, 
                      not taken seriously. Therefore, we need to be able to support young artists, like me lol. 
                      My website is here to document my journey through Johannesburg as an aspiring artist, wanting to change the world.
                      I also want to use this platform to share my art, as well as some research that I have been reading through, 
                      learning about Web Design, the History of it, ethics etc...
