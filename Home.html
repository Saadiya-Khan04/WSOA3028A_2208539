                       Earth can be boring sometimes. We always hear about the weather on Earth, every day, all day. <br> 
                       <br>
                       Don't you wonder about what the weather could possibly be
                       like somewhere else? Maybe not even on this planet. We may not be able to be there to feel the weather, but maybe it could be interesting to know, and compare. 
                       It would be nice if you could easily watch the weather changes in Space. Possibly even imagine what your time would be like in Space, just by looking at the weather.
                       It may even be a slight escape from a mundane, basic day. For now, it will just be the Solar Flares in Space.
