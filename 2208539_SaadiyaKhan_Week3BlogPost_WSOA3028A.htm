<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>A
reflection to What Is Hypertext. </span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>What Hypertext Is ï¿½ Noah Wardrip-Fruin</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>In the text, it is discussed what hypertext is and how it had
become very popular. What is hypertext? It is mentioned that it was originally
a term that was used for hypermedia. Hypermedia, at the time, was seen as a
type of media that was created and written by people to change on request. The
way that certain scholars can define hypertext, or hypermedia, is a connection
through text from one place to another. Hypertext can be seen as a form of
interaction to build knowledge and to inform people about many things. There
are different ways to define the term hypertext, although there is an argument
about which definition can be more right, in comparison to the other. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>The term Hypertext was eventually linked to Theodor Holm
Nelson, also known as Ted. Nelson had decided to write a paper, but a personal
paper, inspired by Vannevar Bush. The terms Hypertext, Hyperfilm and Hypermedia
are all occurring together, at the same time, and Hypertext and Hyperfilm are
both known as new media. There are different form of hypermedia that exist, Nelson
describes how hypermedia are things that react to different types of actions
made by the user, where the process is more artistic than logical, it is being
designed by artists, editors and authors. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>Nelson also poses the new idea of hypergram, where he
describes it as a form of hypertext that is easy to use, as called Stretchtext.
It is different because it does not use links and it is not branching, much
like hypertext. He also moves on to describe another term, known as the
Hypermap, an interface that zooms in smoothly. All of these terms are different
yet they are similar because they are all seen as forms of writing, even if
they are described as textual, or are seen as pictorial. These are seen as
media and not tools, the tools are more of spreadsheets and calculators, as
Noah mentions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>The term of hypertext changed to be defined in a different,
particular way. It was changed because a lot of artists and poets had used the
term hypertext to describe their work in a way of how it is linked to certain
things. In the hypertext community, certain groups had focused on the tools
that Nelson had described as facilities, while also keeping the definition
original as Nelson had described it. There are different focuses that are
evident when it comes to hypertext, where it can be focused on as how it links
within other words, and how the definition can be reconsidered as knowledge
work, as it was described. </span></p>
