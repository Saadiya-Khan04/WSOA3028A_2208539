            An AMV (Anime Music Video) of Tokyo Ghoul scenes, this is my favourite Anime, I could watch it everyday, for the 
            rest of my life :) The song is Monster by Skillet, one of my favourite rock bands! This video is honestly a masterpiece, in 
            my opinion. The fight scenes and animations hit at just the right time with the song.. HINT: It Is Quite Gorey!

            BRING ME THE HORIZON! What more can I say?! The best band to ever and forever walk this planet! If you haven't noticed,
            I am an extreme fan haha! Their music is beautiful, it has helped me get through a lot of tough times. You may have seen 
            on my art and blogs page, I mentioned that I drew him. I do wish he would see it one day, and just AHHH! <br>
            BTW, I'm still mad that they're not coming to Johannesburg on their tour to celebrate their recent album,
            Post-Human Survival: Horror!

            Check out this cool video I found on YouTube about Graffiti in Johannesburg! Ever since I moved here, I have been so intrigued
            and vastly mesmorized at how beautiful street art can be! During my July holiday, I will be touring the city with one of my
            friends, checking out the best grafitti destinations. I'M SO HYPED! Hopefully, if I can, I would love to contact 
            someone who would let me do a cool wall piece, and when I do, IT WILL BE ANIME!

            Soooo, This is the university that I am studying at. It's really cool, and It's massive! I met some really cool friends here 
            and I absolutely love the Arts side. It is beautiful with all of the library lawns, and the people are actually
            really friendly. There are some really cool chill spots, and the buildings are so vintage! NEAT!
            I also really love our gaming room, it has 2 TVs and PlayStations, only accessible to us nerdies! :)
