            <h2>Blog Post 8: Close reading and reflection on Dimara, E. and Perin, C. (2020) ‘What is Interaction for Data Visualization?’</h2>
            <hr>

        <section>
            <p>
            Dimara and Perin discuss what interaction is in the context of data visualization and by further understanding what it is, it can help humans to improve interaction in data 
            visualization. The authors begin to discuss HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), the purpose of the research paper is to properly understand interaction, especially in the 
            context of Human to Computer. The entire journal article makes use of specific papers, articles that the authors had tagged, as references and research for the interaction 
            in data visualization. <br>
            <br>
            This paper consists of multiple research papers on interaction and visualization as references for research. The research shows that, “Interaction has been identified as an 
            overloaded [92] and elusive [36,74] term, and it is challenging to find a solid definition of interaction [36, 74, 126].” (Evanthia Dimara, 2020, p. 3). It is evident that in a 
            few research papers that the visualization system has been defined as technological components, in others it has been identified and defined as a dialogue. Interaction is also 
            defined as physical objects, user actions and representation, these are concepts that are defined within multiple research papers and evidence based research.<br>
            <br>
            The authors begin to discuss the properties that interaction contains and that there are multiple ways of classifying what the properties are. “Continuous interactions involve 
            a sequence of intermediate visualization states between an initial state and a goal state (e.g., mouse drags to perform a lasso selection) [84]. Such interactions happen over a s
            pan of time [76]. With discrete interactions, action and reaction occur in a distinct manner [76] (e.g., clicking on a checkbox to toggle filtering [84])” 
            (Evanthia Dimara, 2020, p. 5). <br>
            <br>
            There are benefits and critiques on interaction, showing that interaction can have both pros and cons to its overall system. The benefits are identified as: 
            it being used to handle large amounts of data and it aids in making data visualization more accessible and appealing to a bigger audience. The critiques being: 
            interaction, compared to representation, is barely focused on when research visualization.<br>
            <br> 
            The goal of this specific research paper had been met by comparing multiple papers that define and elaborate on interaction and visualization, therefore allowing the 
            researchers to come to the conclusion that there are a few ways to describe and compare visualization systems.<br>
            <br> 
            It is crucial to understand what exactly can define interaction in visualization systems because it helps us to better out communication and data visualization, 
            this is important due to the fact that visualization needs to be accessible and easy to understand. Being able to interact with these visualizations can also help 
            people in determining what is being communicated, as well as being able to manipulate the data accurately. <br>
            <br>
            Interaction in data visualization is important, this particular reading was slightly challenging to understand. In my understanding, the authors are researching 
            visualization systems and how they can be interactable. The reading is slightly complicated, due to the fact that it mentions many different papers that can get a 
            bit confusing, as well as not having a very clear conclusion. <br>
