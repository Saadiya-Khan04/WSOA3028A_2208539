            <h2>Blog Post 9: Information is Beautiful – Interactivity as semiotic device</h2>
            <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                According to Kidd in “Theories of Representation”, “Semiotics rests on an understanding that the words, language and other signs which we use in our everyday and social 
                contexts help to shape our reality.” (Kidd, 2016, p. 20). Semiotics are evident when looking at data and data visualizations, due to the fact that these data sets are 
                portrayed in a way that is easy and readable for audiences. Depending on the actual data set, signs and codes play a huge role in data visualization, especially in the 
                context of interactivity. <br>
                <br>
                Using the website “Information is beautiful”, I will be choosing a specific data-driven artwork and analyse it in the context of interactivity and how it can be seen as a 
                semiotic device. The data set that I will be analysing is “Coronavirus Myths and Misconceptions”. <br>
                <br>
                This specific data set is split up into a few categories that users can interact with, with sub categories like: cures, prevention, spread, diagnosis, deadliness and the virus. 
                sers can interact with these sub categories because they are buttons, when interacting with these buttons, the covid information is sorted into its respective sub category, 
                making it easier for users to find specific information. Each icon can be clicked on, users are then taken to another website with more information on the category and 
                heading that the user had clicked on. This form of interactivity is effective because it helps users to find information and properly define or explain the situation that 
                they need information on. <br>
                <br>
                In the context of interactivity as a semiotic device, interactivity, especially in data visualization gives the users the ability to control and manipulate the graph by 
                themselves, or to use it in the way that they would like. It is a semiotic device because it allows users to understand concepts, within social texts, which would help 
                in shaping our reality. (Kidd, 2016, p. 20). <br>
                <br>
                The reason why this specific case study can be so important for people to be able to interact with or to understand it, the case study is about the coronavirus. 
                Audiences and users need to read through and familiarise themselves with the information in this case study, due to the fact that it communicates important information 
                about how to stay safe during the pandemic. Kidd discusses that semiotics can help our society, therefore having data that audiences can interact with can be more 
                effective as they communicate with the audience in ways that they understand. <br>
                <br>
                “Information is beautiful” is a good example of a website that makes use of data visualization and interaction. There were a few examples from this particular 
                website that I would have liked to use as reference for my data visualization. Some of the graphs that are represented om this site are simple to read, with very 
                detailed visualizations. Personally, I would have liked to use more colourful visuals that represent the different data values.<br>
