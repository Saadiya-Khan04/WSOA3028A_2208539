                <p> 
                    I will be using an API that I have found on the NASA website. This specific API will track the weather in Space. For now, it will only display Solar Flares.

                    <br>

            <h3> <b>Why This Specific API?</b> </h3>
    
                <p>
                    It seemed like the most entertaining one to play around with in the list that we were given. It's also interesting to know what the weather could be like in Space.

            <h3> <b>What Inspired Me To Create This?</b> </h3>
    
                <p>
                    As a kid, I always loved looking at the stars and wondering what else could be lurking up there. I eventually started teaching myself about Astronomy 
                    until I got to High-School.
                    I took Science as one of my chosen subjects, I had my heart set on becoming an Astronomer and one day, working for NASA. <br> 
                    Science was not for me, I struggled a lot.
                    That's how I ended up in an Art degree, following my passion for art, games and design. So I decided to take this opportunity and develop this site the way I did, to bring some 
                    nostalgia back into my life and still develop things that I am interested in, that I would like to share with other people.
