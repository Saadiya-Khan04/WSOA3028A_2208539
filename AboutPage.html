<h4> <b>Who Am I?</b> </h4>
 
<p> 
    My name is Yami Mizuki. I am 21 years old. I am quite tall, so call me a "Skyscraper". LOL.
    <br>
    <br>
</p>


<h4> <b> Where Did I Grow Up?</b> </h4>

<p>
    I was born in Tokyo, Japan. A beautiful, busy city that never sleeps. The food is wonderful, as well as the people. <br>
    It's a big city, although if you follow the train schedules, you can get to wherever you need to go!
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

<h4> <b>Why Did I leave Tokyo?</b> </h4>

<p>
    There's nothing left for me in Tokyo at the moment. Maybe I might go back, if anything gets better... You know? <br>
    No one I really care about is-- Well... That's enough about this, lol. <br>
    I decided to leave Tokyo and study in South Africa, a beautiful country, far away from Japan. <br>
    In the busy city of Johannesburg, the University of the Witwatersrand seemed like a cool opportunity for me. 
    <br>
    <br>
    
</p>

<h4> <b>What Is My Passion?</b> </h4>

<p> 
    I love gaming. It's been my passion ever since I was as young as 6 years old. It was there for me when I felt alone, <br>
    when I needed to escape reality. I have always wanted to work for Kojima Productions, he is my role model. <br>
    Coding is fun, you can do a lot with it, much like this website and a lot more! <br>
    It's easy to get lost in games, they have always been my safe space. 
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

<h4> <b>What Am I Studying?</b> </h4>

<p> 
    Well, If that is not obvious to you, surely you have not been reading very well. Obviously it's game design. <br>
    The coding is intense, complicated, but it is fun to learn. Creating games monthly is hectic, but rewarding. <br>
    I feel at peace. I am at Wits, the atmosphere is really a new experience!
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

<h4> <b>Why Do I Have This Site Up?</b> </h4>

<p> 
    I'm not one to share my personal stuff, <i>although</i> I do like sharing my artwork. <br>
    I want to give people ideas and motivation with my art, I want to inspire anyone. <br>
    I also want to display my games and art for companies to see, maybe worldwide.
