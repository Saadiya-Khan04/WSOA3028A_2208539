<b>Who Am I?</b>
<br>
My name is Yami Mizuki. I am 21 years old. I am quite tall, so call me a "Skyscraper". LOL.
<br>
<br>
<b> Where Did I Grow Up?</b>
<br>
I was born in Tokyo, Japan. A beautiful, busy city that never sleeps. The food is wonderful, as well as the people. <br>
It's a big city, although if you follow the train schedules, you can get to wherever you need to go!
<br>
<br>
<b>Why Did I leave Tokyo?</b>
<br>
There's nothing left for me in Tokyo at the moment. Maybe I might go back, if anything gets better... You know? <br>
No one I really care about is-- Well... That's enough about this, lol. 
<br>
<br>
<b>What Is My Passion?</b>
<br>
I love gaming. It's been my passion ever since I was as young as 6 years old. It was there for me when I felt alone, <br>
when I needed to escape reality. I have always wanted to work for Kojima Productions, he is my role model. <br>
Coding is fun, you can do a lot with it, much like this website and a lot more! <br>
It's easy to get lost in games, they have always been my safe space. 
<br>
<br>
<b>What Am I Studying?</b>
<br>
Well, If that is not obvious to you, surely you have not been reading very well. Obviously it's game design. <br>
The coding is intense, complicated, but it is fun to learn. Creating games monthly is hectic, but rewarding. <br>
I feel at peace.. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Why Do I Have This Site Up?</b>
<br>
I'm not one to share my personal stuff, <i>although</i> I do like sharing my artwork. <br>
I want to give people ideas and motivation with my art, I want to inspire anyone. <br>
I also want to display my games and art for companies to see, maybe worldwide.
