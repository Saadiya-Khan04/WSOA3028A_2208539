            <h2>Blog Post 10: Interactivity in my own Interactive Data Visualization</h2>
            <hr>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                Dimara and Perin mention that interactivity can be defined as a number of things, according to multiple research papers that they have reviewed. <br>
                <br>
                In the context of my website, I will be using interactivity as a means of an external action. Dimara and Perin define this form of interactivity as, 
                “EXTERNAL ACTIONS: Interaction is described as a dialogue between the user and the visualization system [36,76,92,98,104,123,126] made of action-reaction pairs 
                [76, 104].” (Perin, 2020, p. 4). Therefore, this specific type of interaction happens when a user directly changes or communicates with the visualization and there 
                is a reaction that occurs due to this communication. <br>
                <br>
                My website displays a bar graph that is collecting data from an API, the API is a NASA weather (Solar Flares) API, the graph should display the Region Number that 
                is given by NASA, for each individual flare, and the time that the solar flare had occurred. Although, my graph is still not working because the data from the API 
                is a bit tricky, there are letters in the output data. The interactivity in this graph makes use of checkboxes for viewers to interact with. The way in which the 
                checkboxes work are: A user can check and uncheck the boxes, and that specific graph will disappear. The boxes have corresponding numbers to the region numbers, 
                therefore checking the box with the same number as one of the bars on the graph will make it disappear.<br>
                <br>
                There are positive reasons as to why the bars should disappear, mainly because reading the data becomes a lot easier. If there are many bars in a bar graph, it can become 
                tricky for the user to accurately read the graph, therefore having control of what you can see will make it easier to read. <br>
                <br>
                In terms of representation and communication, allowing a user to have control of the data visualization without being able to change the actual data can be helpful. 
                When there is a lot of information, specific data values that need to be tracked can often get lost, so it is helpful to be able to change the way it is viewed. 
                The user can then understand the information that is being communicated, and be able to come to a conclusion, depending on what the user is using the data for. 
                In the context of my website, the data is there for people to track when solar flares happen and what is the peak time. We can then see if and how it has impacted 
                Earth’s weather.<br>
