<p>
My character was designed to be like me, but just maybe a bit more interesting. <br>
It is easier to put yourself into a character and talk about your own adventures, feelings and thoughts <br>
as it is more genuine. It feels more real, although it can be slightly exaggerated. <br>
<br>
I am still deciding how this website is going to look, I don't have a definite idea yet. <br>
Planning a website in advanced is tricky, in my opinion, I love to experiment and go along with the ideas that I find interesting. 
<br>
<br>
My vision for character development will be that the content on this blog changes over time, <br>
the images will soon start changing to how Yami explores Johannesburg, with more personal content. 
<br>
<br>
For the next Assignment, there should be better background images that relate to the character <br>
and there should be more about the character and how his life has changed, basically a comparison with a new "About Page".
