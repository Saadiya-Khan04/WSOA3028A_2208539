    <h2>How and Why is my site the way it is, What else to add:</h2>
    <hr>

    
    <h3><u>Rationale Of My Website:</u></h3>
    <p>
        As mentioned on my About Page, I have a huge interest in space. Considering that I did not get to pursue my dream of becoming an Astronomer, I decided to develop a website about it.
        Initially, I started out wanting to use the NASA Mars Weather Service from Insight, although I found out the day that I started my project that it is currently offline, so no 
        data was coming through the API.  I had already done all of my blog posts and prepared for this specific API. I had to change it at the last minute, which was genuinely stressful,
        I had to keep the theme of my website as Space, or I would have to change everything in such a short amount time. I then found another NASA weather service called, "DONKI". This is 
        the Space Weather Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (DONKI). This specific API tracks different types of Space Weather patterns, such as: Solar Flares,
        Geomagnetic Storms, as well as Interplanetary Shock. I chose to use the Solar Flares. This displays the 9 most recent Solar Flares and can update if more are recorded by NASA.
        For now, the data remains the same, but over some days it changes, if more recent Flares have been detected. I would like to implement the other few weather patterns. 
    <br>
    <br>
   </p>

    <h2>
        Website Style Guide:
    </h2>

    <p>
        Considering this is the first assignment, everything is very basic. Even though we got an extension, I still did not have enough time to implement a lot of what I would loved to due
        to Game Design and our Semester Projects. For now, there is a basic style, and users can still explore my site with ease. This website design was based off of my previous website. 
        There are only a few pages for now that is needed for Assignment 1. Personally, I would've liked to add more weather patterns, more images and content about space facts. For my site,
        I would like to focus mainly on design and the theoretical side of my site, as I struggle with coding a lot. I also don't have much time to teach myself concepts in JavaScript as 
        other courses are very demanding. 
    </p>

    <h3><u>Colour Palette:</u></h3>

    <p>
        I decided to keep it a dark theme, it is easier on the eyes and personally I like the look of it. The space image on the banner is something that I am proud of, I really like the 
        colours, even just the image overall. The colours that I have chosen for the majority of the site: Black, Purple and Blue. In my head, these colours somehow remind me of Space
        when put together. The main headings are blue, in a purple dashed-line box, this to add a bit of texture to my site, as everything is always straight lines. The sub-headings are 
        purple, this is to make them pop out, while not needing to be in too big or bold of a font. The white text stands out on the black background and it brings in a bit of light 
        into the web pages. 
        <br>
        I like the tone that these colours set for my site, they are vivid and go well together. The colour choice also comes from images of galaxies, these are most often purples and blues.
    </p>
 
    <h3><u>Fonts Used:</u></h3>

    <p>
        Sans-serif and Courier. 
        For my main headings, I used Sans-serif, this seemed to pop out and seem more bold in the shade of blue that I decided to use. It also goes well with the purple dashed-line border.
        My sub headings are Courier, I like this font a lot too, it looks like an old computer font, in my opinion. It looks quite bold for a sub-heading as well.   
    </p>

    <h3><u>Mood Board:</u></h3>

    <p>
        The overall mood seems to be determined by the colour schemes and content used throughout the site. The mood that I am trying to portray is a very mellow kind of feeling.
        The colours are soft colours in my opinions, the purple and blues. It should feel like the theme is actually Space. When I started this website out, the colour scheme was going
        to be shades of red and orange, because the API that I was going to use was the Mars Weather Rover. 
    </p>

    <h3><u>Content pages:</u></h3>

    <p>
       There are 4 pages of content for now, I decided to put each different type of content on it's own page, this way it is easier to navigate. <br> 
       - Blog Content: These are just simple sections on the page with downloadable MS Word documents that contain the Blog Posts we had to submit this semester. 
       Some content may be slightly different due to the API change.<br> 
       - Solar Flares: This page indicates the information given from the API through the NASA DONKI API. When the page refreshes it checks for solar flare updates. There will not be 
       sudden changes on every day. Although, the last 9 solar flares are displayed, including the date, Flare ID given by NASA and it's peak time. <br> 
       - D3 Graphs: This will contain both graphs with the API information displayed. I'm not too keen on this yet, I am still struggling to grasp the concepts to create graphs. <br>
       - Space Facts: Very basic space facts, more facts will be added and grouped into more categories. 
    </p>

    <h3><u>Content Used:</u></h3>

    <p>
        There will be many more images of Space, especially from the Hubble telescope from the official NASA website. 
        <br>
        - The pciture of the Red Moon is actually a picture that I had taken on a lunar eclipse through my own telescope. 
        <br>
        - Blog Posts: These are the required, weekly posts that we had to reflect on. It is incorporated into the site as a requirement. 
        
    </p>

    <h3><u>Things I Wish I Could Have Added:</u></h3>

    <p>
        There is a lot more that I wish I could have implemented to refine and develop my website for Assignment 1. I would have liked to add another type of Space Weather Pattern. 
        More Hubble Telescope pictures would be nice, in the form of a slideshow gallery. I would also like to implement better graphs, showing more information, as well as being 
        easy to read for the user.  
    </p>

    <p>
        I have made quite a few changes in Assignment 2. <br>
        Graphs: I attempted the graph manipulation but the data from my API is a bit tricky to work with. My graph works with regular data, <br>
        I just need help to figure out how to manipulate it with my API data. <br> 
        Images: I added a manual slideshow of 5 pictures that were taken through the Hubble Telescope, for aesthetic purposes, also for more of a 
        visual site. <br> 
        NASA Info: I added a link to the official NASA website that opens a new tab instead of loading the same web page. Here, viewers can access more
        NASA content. <br>
        Wireframes: I added the wireframes for the slideshow page, NASA page and the space facts page (This page was added in Assignment 1, I just added
        its wireframe).<br>
        Blogs: This Quarter's Blog posts are added. The blogs also don't trigger a download anymore, they open on the site instead.
