                Although I have not yet implemented my two graphs into my site yet, I am planning on implementing a line graph and most likely a dual-bar graph. 
                The graphs that I will be implementing will be displaying data that is taken from my API that I have chosen. This will be the Mars Weather Service API from the 
                Official NASA website.<br>
                <br> 
                What will be displayed from this API will be the daily temperature on Mars. The graphs will have the Mars day, earth date, minimum and maximum daily temperatures. 
                Not only will the graphs display the weather, but also the atmospheric pressure changes on Mars. Although these have not yet been implemented, I would eventually 
                like to further the graph information by adding the daily weather, where users can enter the daily Earth weather and compare the difference on Earth and Mars.<br>
                <br> 
                In regards to representation, the graphs will be representing the data set from the API and being displayed. This will be the Mars daily weather. 
                According to Kidd’s research in “Theories of Representation”, making use of graphs is a form of data visualization, this can be classified as a form of code/sign that 
                Kidd mentions. (Kidd, 2016). The representation that my graphs will be having can be seen as a form of data and knowledge as it is displaying valuable information in a 
                way that can be read clearly by readers.<br>
                <br>
                In regards to communication, the site and graphs will be clear, where the information is easily accessible to the reader, as well as displaying the information is 
                multiple colours. There may be a possibility that the reader can switch the graphs options and be able to read the information in a way that could make sense to them. 
                Communication design is an important aspect in web design, this determines whether or not the readers can understand what exactly is being communicated to them and if it 
                clear enough to understand. These can depend on colour schemes, data visualization, fonts, layout and even movement through the website. This can be linked back to Li in 
                “Embodying Data”, we can see that aesthetics play a huge role in the understanding of data in data visualization, as colour scheme and layout of visualizations can impact the 
                information that is displayed.<br>
                <br>
                According to Knaflic in “Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals”, the way that information is displayed is important, as it 
                helps the reader determine and understand what exactly is being displayed. Knaflic mentions that graphs are created by different people, therefore they will have 
                different aspects, and will either be helpful or not, it depends on the person that is creating them. Good graph creation can be subjective, although, the information 
                that is displayed has to be easy to understand, this being the simplest form of a graph being classified as good.<br>
