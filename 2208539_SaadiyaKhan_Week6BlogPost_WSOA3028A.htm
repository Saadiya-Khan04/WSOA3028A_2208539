<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>A
reflection to User Experience</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'>User
Experience - Marc Hassenzahl &amp; Noam Tractinsky</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>User experience can be associated with a different variety of
meanings, such as how it can be used and how it can make something look better.
It is mentioned that User Experience is important when it comes to any designs,
although it is never really original and that user experience had been around for
a long time but was only really taken seriously about a decade after it was
introduced. Although, the first information and writings about it were more
technical, in the sense where it was more programmatic. Considering it is not
definite with what made the user experience almost perfect, it had to be discussed
and agreed upon as to what would actually be considered as a good user experience.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>It can be seen that the understanding of the user experience
is because of the lack of empirical research, as stated in the paper, it
restricts further development and understanding. Therefore, the authors had decided
to find papers that had actually contributed to the understanding and the improvement
of the user interface, and 28 papers were submitted about the user experience and
being reviewed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>Researchers had different views on what the user experience is,
how it should be used and what it should look like. There were cases such as: Studying
the user experience with entertainment factors, there are certain ways to
express emotion that can be evident in how the user experience is designed, how
it changes the quality in the way businesses reach the consumers. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>In conclusion, it can be seen that all of the papers that had
been reviewed, none of them had been able to fully describe the user
experience. It is mentioned that there is more to the user experience than just
knowledge and technology. It is about the way that moods, emotions, needs are
portrayed as it being a consequence of the usersï¿½ states. The idea of user
experience is forever growing and changing, and it can be seen that it is not a
coincidence that there is experiential and emotional aspects that are being
focused on when studying the user experience. In light of what a positive user
experience would be, is that is focuses more on creating a good quality of an
experience, rather than the prevention of problems that come about with usability.
The idea of user experience stays alive and is driven by designers, authors and
businesses, as it impacts the ideas and work that has been created. </span></p>
