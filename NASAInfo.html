                <h3><u>Why You Should Check It Out</u></h3>

                <p>
                    NASA's Website has a variety of information and images that anyone can access. Personally, I think it's good to know what's happening <br>
                    at NASA because of all of the achievements that Humans are making in space exploration. <br>
                    The site also contains "Image of the Day", it's fun to watch the site get updated daily with new pictures.
                    <br>
                    The coolest thing that I came across on the site is the "Missions" tab. NASA updates the site about all of the new space missions and what they aim to achieve 
                    <br>(The plans are very detailed), as well as
                    new discoveries made through these missions.
