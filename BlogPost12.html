            <p>
                “Information is beautiful” is a website that was specifically developed to be a form of data-driven artworks. On this website, there are multiple categories of data, such as: 
                Healthcare, nature and animals, conflict and crime, and clean energy. All of these categories contain data and information of each respective category that helps to inform 
                audiences of what is happening in each category. The information contains sources that are trustworthy, therefore audiences can go to the original source and fact check these 
                data documents.<br>
                <br>
                The reason why the content on this website can be classified as data-driven artwork is because the data that is published makes use of art strategies, which is data 
                visualization, to make the data more interesting and easier to read for different types of audiences. <br>
                <br>
                I will be analyzing “Beautiful News Daily”, it is not one specific artwork on the website, but a sub-page that contains many categories of news and headlines that are positive.
                ach artwork is different for each headline or statistic that is being portrayed, so that it catches attention and is unique compared to the other artworks. There is a news 
                article about how there are a lot of electric cars being sold in Norway, which is good for the environment. The data includes the popularity of each electric car brand sold 
                and the percentage of cars that are sold, as well as the overall total, which is 49.5%. <br>
                <br>
                This specific data set is portrayed as a horizontal bar graph but instead of bars used to portray the data, minimal images of cars are used. The names of the car brands 
                are also in the fonts of each respective brand, so users are more familiar with the brand. The images are effective because they show what the data set is about, cars, 
                without the user having to read anything. <br>
                <br>
                The meaning that is created can be seen as helpful, informing and positive news. This data set accurately shows users the sales of electric cars in Norway, this is 
                informative because of its accurate information source, as well as its visualization of data. The data is easy to read, therefore it is easier for audiences to 
                understand and interpret. The article, overall, has a positive light, due to the fact that it communicates information that is not harmful to anyone or anything. 
                It should also enlighten people and convince them to be part of the positive data, in this case, buying an electric car as a next, new car, to help the environment. <br>
