        <section>
            <p>
                Wattenberg and Viégas discuss and research information visualization in an artistic context, this describes how artists use scientific techniques in order to create a form 
                of data visualization using art.<br>
                <br>
                “Data visualization is usually viewed as a tool to support analytic reasoning.” (Wattenberg, 2007, p. 182). The authors describe data visualization as a way of explaining 
                and describing why and what the data is about in a specific article. The authors discuss that in order for it to be classified as artistic data visualization, the art should 
                be based on real data. The authors mention that artistic data visualization is not developed to be aesthetically pleasing but rather why it is developed and how it functions.<br> 
                <br>
                Wattenberg and Viégas research the qualities that artistic data visualizations have by looking at examples from existing forms of artistic data visualization. They mention 
                that information visualization can help audiences to see data patterns such as trends, maximum and minimum data value sets. There are different examples that are explored, 
                through specifically Jason Salavon’s work, showing the similarities, differences and changes over a few pieces of art throughout the decades, such as houses for sale, class
                yearbook pictures and even narrative changes.<br>
                <br> 
                The idea of these art pieces are to take different pictures of a similar category and manipulate the picture by making the pixels bigger and blurring them out. These artists 
                use this technique, while still keeping the original colour scheme, which then allows viewers to see the similarities and differences in these images. Another artist that is 
                discussed in this paper and uses the same technique as Jason Salavon is Golan Levin.<br>
                <br>
                Golan Levin makes use of a similar method, but uses it to manipulate data sets with numbers and letters, this has its own set of rules on how to interpret, read and understand
                this specific data visualization technique. <br>
                <br>
                Jussi Ängeslevä and Ross Cooper had also used art to visualize a data set, but instead of using images or numbers, they used video footage to record time. 
                Instead of showing the changes in things over time and using a number data set, this shows the changes of places or settings over time. <br>
                <br>
                The authors mention how social networking has also become important and useful when it comes to analysing data. This makes use of objects and places in communities that are 
                represented and people can make use of these data sets. 
                In conclusion, these forms of artistic data visualization can be helpful and expressive, although some are just purely aesthetic. The clock by Jussi Ängeslevä and 
                Ross Cooper is purely aesthetic because the images cannot be helpful for real-time surveillance, although Jason Salavon’s image distortions can be helpful by seeing a
                verage trends over time, through images. <br>
                <br>
                A website that has helpful information can also have detailed aesthetics. I agree with the artists that are mentioned in this particular article, information of specific 
                types have their own trends, therefore making use of those trends and transforming it through art can be helpful when designing a site that also focuses on aesthetics. 
                My website has the overall theme of space, because of the NASA information that I am using. My data values come from a NASA API, therefore having a space theme with the 
                data makes sense.<br>
