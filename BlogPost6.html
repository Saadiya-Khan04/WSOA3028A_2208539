            <p>
                Using the site, “Information is Beautiful”, I have decided to use a particular case study about the news. The case study is called, “365 Days of Beautiful News”, 
                making use of different types of graphs that are displayed on colourful tiles and bold headings, as well as topics sorted out into different categories. 
                This specific case study has taken one positive news article per day and compiled everything into a site that can be accessed to review the information.<br>
                <br> 
                As mentioned earlier, this specific case study has an entire website that was built just for positive daily news. The news is collected from articles in newspapers, 
                media and interviews from all around the world, therefore it is not country specific. There are positive news articles about almost any topic, including: Health, nature, 
                crime and even information about women. There are buttons at the top of the page that splits the news articles into different categories, so they are easier to find if you
                know what category you want to read positive news articles from. Below the category buttons there are more buttons that sort a specific category into its sub-category, 
                making information easier to find, like: There is a main category for “Eco & Climate” and under this category there are sub-categories like: Eco-tech, Forests, Oceans etc.<br>
                <br> 
                Each news article has its own specific tile that is displayed on the web page with different colour schemes, so they can be differentiated. There are very basic statistics 
                on display for readers to have a quick glance of the displayed information. The data visualization is through different types of graphs, diagrams, maps and charts. 
                The headings on each tile stand out more than the information given, this catches the readers attention. When an individual tile is clicked, the user is taken to another 
                page that gives more information about the article, in more detail. There is a short description of the article, as well as options to see the data individually and the 
                exact source that the article comes from. This is evidence to reassure readers that the information is genuine and allows them to read the data in further detail.<br>
                <br> 
                According to Kidd in “Theories of Representation”, there are forms of representation in codes and signs that we can see all around us, everything that we see has 
                an underlying meaning. In regard to the data visualization in this specific web site, we can see that the graphs and charts all have a meaning and that they represent 
                something specific to the articles that they represent. In this particular case, the graphs represent information that relates to the article. The site also makes use of 
                good communication techniques, all of the articles are categorized, making information searching easier, there are different colour schemes that flow through the page 
                showing different articles, as well as the use of different graphs/forms of data visualization, this matters because some information needs to be graphed out in different 
                ways to make sense to the reader. <br>
