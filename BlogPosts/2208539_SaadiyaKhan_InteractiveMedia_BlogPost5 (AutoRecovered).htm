style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;background:white'>Cole
Nussbaumer Knaflic, there is the discussion of  data visualization and what
classifies it as good visualization. As well as the design process that has
been thought of and implemented into creating different forms of data
visualization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black;background:white'>It is important when planning graphs to know what
piece of data would need emphasis and what can be used to catch the audience’s
attention too. In this chapter, Knaflic creates different types of graphs that
portray data differently and which are more effective when it comes to data
visualization. What can also be criticised to be an example of good data
visualization can include visible fonts and specific colour schemes, as well as
extra information that can be helpful to a reader, but the reader is not
dependent on this information in order to read the graph. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black;background:white'>In the first visual, there is a line graph that
plots a certain set of data, in this case it is a company’s charity campaign. The
way that the data is portrayed is simple, as it is easy to read. What makes it
easy to read is the way that data is spaced out in increments on the x and
y-axis. Knaflic states that there is no right way to plot data into a graph, as
it depends on how the creator wants the graph to be and what aspect they want
emphasis on, which aspect that they want the audience to focus on (Knaflic, 2015 ).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black;background:white'>Moving on to the second line graph, this shows a
company’s sales over time and a forecast assumption of what will be made in the
years to come. Knaflic mentions that very often there are cases where companies
use this method, but they plot both sets of data on line, this can be
misleading and even difficult to read (Knaflic, 2015 ).</span><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:red;background:white'> </span><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black;background:white'>Although,
putting the information in one line can still be effective by making the
predicted forecast of sales line a broken line. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black;background:white'>The third graph can be seen as a stacked bar
graph, with information of goals that have been missed, achieved and exceeded. What
stands out in this bar graph is the missed goals, as it is in a dark red, which
draws attention to the audience, meaning that the emphasis was on the missed
goals. The rest of the graph easily depicts what has been met with goals,
although the trend is a lot more difficult to read as it becomes harder to read
and track percentages when a reader is further away from the y-axis. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black;background:white'>There are a few other graphs that are discussed
with similar properties and why they could be good visualizations of data, and
how they could possibly be improved for better audience reading, as well as
keeping track of information. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:black;background:white'>In conclusion, graphs really depend on who is
making them, plotting the data and the target audience. There are many aspects
that can make the graphs look good or bad, such as colour schemes, spacing of
information, method of plotting information and even the way that the data is
being measured along the x and y-axis. What does tend to matter is more is the
usability of the graph and its effectiveness, where it simple to read from the
audience perspective, this can be the main aspect as to what makes a graph a
good form of data visualization. </span></p>
