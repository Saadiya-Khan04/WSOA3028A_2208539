<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Using
the site, “<i><u>Information is Beautiful</u></i>”, I have decided to use a
particular case study about the news. The case study is called, “<i><u>365 Days
of Beautiful News</u></i>”, making use of different types of graphs that are
displayed on colourful tiles and bold headings, as well as topics sorted out
into different categories. This specific case study has taken one positive news
article per day and compiled everything into a site that can be accessed to
review the information. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>As
mentioned earlier, this specific case study has an entire website that was
built just for positive daily news. The news is collected from articles in
newspapers, media and interviews from all around the world, therefore it is not
country specific. There are positive news articles about almost any topic,
including: Health, nature, crime and even information about women. There are
buttons at the top of the page that splits the news articles into different categories,
so they are easier to find if you know what category you want to read positive
news articles from. Below the category buttons there are more buttons that sort
a specific category into its sub-category, making information easier to find,
like: There is a main category for “Eco &amp; Climate” and under this category
there are sub-categories like: Eco-tech, Forests, Oceans etc. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Each
news article has its own specific tile that is displayed on the web page with
different colour schemes, so they can be differentiated. There are very basic
statistics on display for readers to have a quick glance of the displayed
information. The data visualization is through different types of graphs,
diagrams, maps and charts. The headings on each tile stand out more than the
information given, this catches the readers attention. When an individual tile
is clicked, the user is taken to another page that gives more information about
the article, in more detail. There is a short description of the article, as
well as options to see the data individually and the exact source that the
article comes from. This is evidence to reassure readers that the information
is genuine and allows them to read the data in further detail. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>According
to Kidd in “<i><u>Theories of Representation</u></i>”, there are forms of
representation in codes and signs that we can see all around us, everything
that we see has an underlying meaning. In regard to the data visualization in
this specific web site, we can see that the graphs and charts all have a
meaning and that they represent something specific to the articles that they
represent. In this particular case, the graphs represent information that
relates to the article. The site also makes use of good communication
techniques, all of the articles are categorized, making information searching
easier, there are different colour schemes that flow through the page showing
different articles, as well as the use of different graphs/forms of data
visualization, this matters because some information needs to be graphed out in
different ways to make sense to the reader. </span></p>
