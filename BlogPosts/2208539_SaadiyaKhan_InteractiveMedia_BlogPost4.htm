Visualization </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Data
visualization is a visual representation of data or information. This can be
graphs, charts and maps of any kind that can display information accurately. This
also helpful in being able to see common data sources, outliers and common
trends in the data that is being provided. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>I
will be analysing maps as a form of data visualization, as they were actually
the first forms of data visualization, cartography. There are different ways
that data can be displayed on maps, such as: Heat maps, line maps, point maps, land
owner ship, flow maps and regional maps. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Maps
were used historically, for data visualization even before it was categorized
as data visualization. People had used maps to show significant land data,
where cities, towns, building, churches, roads and cities were. These are
landmarks that helped people navigate there way through places without getting
lost. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Personally,
I believe that having a map as data visualization for specific data can be
really helpful. It becomes of aid to people with navigation and exploration, it
informs, as well as communicates. Although, not all maps were necessarily
perfect/accurate at the time of development or creation. Only after measurement
tools were invented did maps become more accurate with distances and
measurements, then having the press eventually mass producing and printing more
accurate maps. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>According
to Kidd, “<i><u>Theories of Representation</u></i>”, in “Representations in
Reality” (Kidd, 2016), Kidd discusses the way language, symbols and code have a
representation in our reality. This can be portrayed in maps using data
visualization. The signs and symbols on the map have their own representations
and meanings, therefore making it easier and universally known as to what the
symbols mean on a map. Symbols and codes are like having a language that is
universally understood, allowing communication and information to be displayed
easily. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>According
to Thompson, “<i><u>The Surprising History of the Infographic</u></i>”, “The
idea of visualizing data is old: After all, that’s what a map is—a
representation of geographic information—and we’ve had maps for about 8,000
years.” (Thompson, 2016 ). Thompson mentions how rare data was and that there
never was data that was published, as it had not been collected yet. this
changed when people had finally become more aware and started publishing their
data, therefore being able to use it to fix problems and social issues. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In
conclusion, data visualization has been around for a really long time,
especially maps as a source of visualization. This allowed people to begin
understanding data and how it can be used to fix issues, as well as displaying
data and information to track to data, look at trends and outliers in sets of
data. </span></p>
