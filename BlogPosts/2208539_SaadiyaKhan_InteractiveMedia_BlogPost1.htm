<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Overview of
Data Visualization – Li (2020) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In
this chapter, Li talks about the concept of data visualization and the
relationship between aesthetics and data visualization. Li also discusses the
many different forms of visual data representation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Data
visualization, as described by Card, Mackinlay and Schneiderman (1999), data
visualization is defined as “the use of computer-supported, interactive, visual
representations of data to amplify cognition” (P. 6). Data visualization is an
important part of research as it has contributed to many different inventions
and discoveries throughout history. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Li
begins to discuss that the invention of technology has had an impact on the way
the data is processed and communicated through visual representation, data
visualization is an important part of human research as it also helps with data
analysis, thus being more accurate through the graphical data visualization. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>There
are a few advantages to having the traditional form of data visualization, such
as: having the ability to gather huge amounts of data immediately, it enables
people to see patterns in data and invent new ideas, as well as identifies
problems immediately due to the use of data analysis. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>According
to Bikakis (2018), data visualization has 4 main aspects, these include:
real-time interaction, on-the-fly processing, visual scalability and user
assistance and personalization. In summary, the real-time interaction refers to
making use of something at the same time and getting the response back
immediately, on-the-fly can be categorized as raw data that needs processing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Li
discusses that there is information visualization and scientific visualization.
Information visualization tends to be focused on the communication of
information and its accuracy. The information visualization can be categorized
into three different parts: organized information, understanding and input. This
involves maps, charts, tables, diagrams and graphs. In the scientific
visualization, there are different forms of data visualization such as:
waveforms, volume and simulations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Li
then begins to discuss each form of data visualization, in depth, as to what
they are, where they originate from, how they have evolved and how they are
used. Then going on to discuss the characteristics of traditional data
visualization, it should be readable, users should be able to recognize it and
communicate information that is easily understandable. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>It
can also be seen that our perception as human beings plays a huge role in data
visualization. Perception can be defined as data that is collected, organized
and then  interpreting that data in a different means. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>To
conclude, there is no relation to these data visualizations and aesthetics as
they have ignored aesthetic and rather have contributed to the information
processing. These aesthetics are not necessarily only art related as they also
come with techniques, methods and ideas. </span></p>
