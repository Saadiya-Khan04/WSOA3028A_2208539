<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In this Blog Post I will be
discussing the UI, UX and Design of my own, personal website this semester. The
UX, UI and Design of a website are very important, as it determines how people
interact with your website and whether or not it is a site worth exploring and
going back. If a website it is good, it should have the characteristics of a
good user experience, allowing users to have a good experience when using your
site. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>“<i>Interpreting the Layout of
Web Pages</i>”, written by Luis Francisco-Revilla and Jeff Crow, they discuss
what a modular layout is when it comes to web design. Websites that contains a
modular layout can often be seen as news sites and online shopping stores. Although
designing sites like this are complex and time consuming, they are actually
developed to be the easiest way to display information and content on a site.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Making use of these,
personally, I would like to attempt to try a modular layout. There will be
multiple images and content in columns, making the site simple to explore, as
well as giving the user a good experience. Drawing inspiration from my last
website, I would like to keep a few things the same, moving forward for when I
start designing my new site. There will be a banner that scrolls with the page,
the content pages will be very similar, as well as having more visuals. These
are original ideas from last site. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>My new site will also have a
different colour scheme, black, blue and purple. I chose these colours because
they come to mind when I think about astronomy and space. I would like to
explore an automatic scrolling image gallery that will display images from the
real Hubble telescope. The API that I will be using will be a NASA API,
specifically the DONKI weather services. I chose this because we always know
what the weather is like on Earth every day, it would be interesting to know
what the weather patterns are like in space. In terms of User Experience, as
discussed earlier, I will be attempting to try a modular layout for my site. As
well as scrolling banner that will be interactable with while on any part of
the page, although I have done this, it does make site navigation easier. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In conclusion, drawing from “<i>Theories
of Representation</i>” (Kidd, 2016), written by Jenny Kidd, it can be seen that
the passage “Representation and Reality” explains the semiotics of signs, codes
and language and how they mean certain things. Referring to this ideology, in
conjunction with my site, I would like there to be a sense of narrative through
the signs, graphs and visuals that are added to the site. It becomes more
meaningful when there are ideas of representation that actually tell a
narrative, and they mean many things. </span></p>
