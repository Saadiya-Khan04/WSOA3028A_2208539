<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Although
I have not yet implemented my two graphs into my site yet, I am planning on
implementing a line graph and most likely a bar graph. The graphs that I will
be implementing will be displaying data that is taken from my API that I have
chosen. This will be the DONKI Weather Service API from the Official NASA
website. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>What
will be displayed from this API will be different space weather patterns. The
graphs will have the dates of the weather occurrences, as well as its peak time.
Although these have not yet been implemented, I would eventually like to
further the graph information by adding more space weather occurrences. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In
regards to representation, the graphs will be representing the data set from
the API and being displayed. This will be the space weather patterns, like
solar flares, interplanetary shocks and geomagnetic storms.. According to
Kidd’s research in “<i><u>Theories of Representation</u></i>”, making use of
graphs is a form of data visualization, this can be classified as a form of
code/sign that Kidd mentions. (Kidd, 2016). The representation that my graphs
will be having can be seen as a form of data and knowledge as it is displaying
valuable information in a way that can be read clearly by readers. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In
regards to communication, the site and graphs will be clear, where the information
is easily accessible to the reader, as well as displaying the information is
multiple colours. There may be a possibility that the reader can switch the
graphs options and be able to read the information in a way that could make
sense to them. Communication design is an important aspect in web design, this
determines whether or not the readers can understand what exactly is being
communicated to them and if it clear enough to understand. These can depend on colour
schemes, data visualization, fonts, layout and even movement through the
website. This can be linked back to Li in “<i><u>Embodying Data</u></i>”, we
can see that aesthetics play a huge role in the understanding of data in data
visualization, as colour scheme and layout of visualizations can impact the
information that is displayed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>According
to Knaflic in “<i><u><span style='color:black;background:white'>Storytelling
with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals</span></u></i><span
style='color:#202124;background:white'>”, the way that information is displayed
is important, as it helps the reader determine and understand what exactly is
being displayed. Knaflic mentions that graphs are created by different people,
therefore they will have different aspects, and will either be helpful or not,
it depends on the person that is creating them. Good graph creation can be
subjective, although, the information that is displayed has to be easy to
understand, this being the simplest form of a graph being classified as good. </span></span></p>
