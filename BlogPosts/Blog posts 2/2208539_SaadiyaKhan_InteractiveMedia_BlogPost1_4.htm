<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Dimara
and Perin discuss what interaction is in the context of data visualization and
by further understanding what it is, it can help humans to improve interaction
in data visualization. The authors begin to discuss HCI (Human-Computer
Interaction), the purpose of the research paper is to properly understand
interaction, especially in the context of Human to Computer. The entire journal
article makes use of specific papers, articles that the authors had tagged, as
references and research for the interaction in data visualization. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>This
paper consists of multiple research papers on interaction and visualization as references
for research. The research shows that, “Interaction has been identified as an
overloaded [92] and elusive [36,74] term, and it is challenging to find a solid
definition of interaction [36, 74, 126].” (Evanthia Dimara, 2020, p. 3). It is
evident that in a few research papers that the visualization system has been
defined as technological components, in others it has been identified and
defined as a dialogue. Interaction is also defined as physical objects, user
actions and representation, these are concepts that are defined within multiple
research papers and evidence based research. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
authors begin to discuss the properties that interaction contains and that
there are multiple ways of classifying what the properties are. “Continuous
interactions involve a sequence of intermediate visualization states between an
initial state and a goal state (e.g., mouse drags to perform a lasso selection)
[84]. Such interactions happen over a span of time [76]. With discrete
interactions, action and reaction occur in a distinct manner [76] (e.g.,
clicking on a checkbox to toggle filtering [84])” (Evanthia Dimara, 2020, p. 5).
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>There
are benefits and critiques on interaction, showing that interaction can have
both pros and cons to its overall system. The benefits are identified as: it
being used to handle large amounts of data and it aids in making data
visualization more accessible and appealing to a bigger audience. The critiques
being: interaction, compared to representation, is barely the focused on when
research visualization. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
goal of this specific research paper had been met by comparing multiple papers
that define and elaborate on interaction and visualization, therefore allowing
the researchers to come to the conclusion that there are a few ways to describe
and compare visualization systems. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>It
is crucial to understand what exactly can define interaction in visualization
systems because it helps us to better out communication and data visualization,
this is important due to the fact that visualization needs to be accessible and
easy to understand. Being able to interact with these visualizations can also
help people in determining what is being communicated, as well as being able to
manipulate the data accurately. </span></p>
