<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Dimara
and Perin mention that interactivity can be defined as a number of things,
according to multiple research papers that they have reviewed.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In
the context of my website, I will be using interactivity as a means of an
external action. Dimara and Perin define this form of interactivity as, “EXTERNAL
ACTIONS: Interaction is described as a dialogue between the user and the
visualization system [36,76,92,98,104,123,126] made of action-reaction pairs
[76, 104].” (Perin, 2020, p. 4). Therefore, this specific type of interaction
happens when a user directly changes or communicates with the visualization and
there is a reaction that occurs due to this communication. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>My
website displays a bar graph that is collecting data from an API, the API is a
NASA weather (Solar Flares) API, the graph should display the Region Number
that is given by NASA, for each individual flare, and the time that the solar
flare had occurred. Although, my graph is still not working because the data
from the API is a bit tricky, there are letters in the output data. The
interactivity in this graph makes use of checkboxes for viewers to interact
with. The way in which the checkboxes work are: A user can check and uncheck
the boxes, and that specific graph will disappear. The boxes have corresponding
numbers to the region numbers, therefore checking the box with the same number
as one of the bars on the graph will make it disappear. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>There
are positive reasons as to why the bars should disappear, mainly because
reading the data becomes a lot easier. If there are many bars in a bar graph,
it can become tricky for the user to accurately read the graph, therefore
having control of what you can see will make it easier to read. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In
terms of representation and communication, allowing a user to have control of
the data visualization without being able to change the actual data can be
helpful. When there is a lot of information, specific data values that need to
be tracked can often get lost, so it is helpful to be able to change the way it
is viewed. The user can then understand the information that is being
communicated, and be able to come to a conclusion, depending on what the user
is using the data for. In the context of my website, the data is there for
people to track when solar flares happen and what is the peak time. We can then
see if and how it has impacted Earth’s weather. </span></p>
