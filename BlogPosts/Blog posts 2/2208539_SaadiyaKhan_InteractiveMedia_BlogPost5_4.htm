<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Data-driven
Art&nbsp;– Information Is Beautiful </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>“Information is beautiful” is a website that was
specifically developed to be a form of data-driven artworks. On this website,
there are multiple categories of data, such as: Healthcare, nature and animals,
conflict and crime, and clean energy. All of these categories contain data and
information of each respective category that helps to inform audiences of what
is happening in each category. The information contains sources that are trustworthy,
therefore audiences can go to the original source and fact check these data
documents.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>The reason why the content on this website can be
classified as data-driven artwork is because the data that is published makes
use of art strategies, which is data visualization, to make the data more
interesting and easier to read for different types of audiences. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>I will be analyzing “Beautiful News Daily”, it is not one
specific artwork on the website, but a sub-page that contains many categories
of news and headlines that are positive. Each artwork is different for each
headline or statistic that is being portrayed, so that it catches attention and
is unique compared to the other artworks. There is a news article about how
there are a lot of electric cars being sold in Norway, which is good for the
environment. The data includes the popularity of each electric car brand sold
and the percentage of cars that are sold, as well as the overall total, which
is 49.5%. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
"Arial",sans-serif'>This specific data set is portrayed as a horizontal bar
graph but instead of bars used to portray the data, minimal images of cars are
used. The names of the car brands are also in the fonts of each respective
brand, so users are more familiar with the brand. The images are effective
because they show what the data set is about, cars, without the user having to
read anything. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
meaning that is created can be seen as helpful, informing and positive news. This
data set accurately shows users the sales of electric cars in Norway, this is
informative because of its accurate information source, as well as its visualization
of data. The data is easy to read, therefore it is easier for audiences to
understand and interpret. The article, overall, has a positive light, due to
the fact that it communicates information that is not harmful to anyone or
anything. It should also enlighten people and convince them to be part of the
positive data, in this case, buying an electric car as a next, new car, to help
the environment. </span></p>
