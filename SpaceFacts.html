            <h2>Some Facts About Space And Solar Flares</h2>
            <hr>

            <h3><u>What Are Solar Flares?</u></h3>
            <p>
                A brief eruption of intense high-energy radiation from the sun's surface, associated with sunspots and causing radio 
                and magnetic disturbances on the earth.
            </p>
            <h4><u>What Causes Solar Flares?</u></h4>
            <p>
                "The magnetic field lines near sunspots often tangle, cross, and reorganize. This can cause a sudden explosion 
                of energy called a solar flare. Solar flares release a lot of radiation into space. <br> If a solar flare is very intense, 
                the radiation it releases can interfere with our radio communications here on Earth."

            <h3><u>Some Space Facts</u></h3>
            <p>
                Space is full of interesting facts. There are so many things that we still do not know about the Universe. <br>
                What a vast and amazing place it is!
            </p>
            <h4><u>1. SPACE IS COMPLETELY SILENT</u></h4>
            <p>
                There is no atmosphere in space, which means that sound has no medium or way to travel to be heard. 
            </p>
            <h4><u>2. THE HOTTEST PLANET IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM IS 450° C.</u></h4>
            <p>
                Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system and has an average surface temperature of around 450° C. 
                Did you know that Venus isn't the closest planet to the sun?  That is Mercury. You would think that Mercury would then 
                be the hottest, but Mercury has no atmosphere (which regulates temperature), resulting in big fluctuations. 
            </p>
            <h4><u>3. THE SUN’S MASS TAKES UP 99.86% OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.</u></h4>
            <p>
                The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in our solar system with a mass of around 330,000 times that of Earth. 
                Did you know that the Sun is made up of mostly hydrogen (three quarters worth) with the rest of its mass attributed to helium.  
                If the Sun had a voice would it be high and squeaky from all that helium?
            </p>
            <h4><u>4.  ONE MILLION EARTHS CAN FIT INSIDE THE SUN</u></h4>
            <p>
                The Sun is large enough that approximately 1.3 million Earths could fit inside (if squashed in) or if the Earths retained their 
                spherical shape then 960,000 would fit. But can you visualise that number of Earths? 
            </p>
            <h4><u>5. THERE ARE MORE TREES ON EARTH THAN STARS IN THE MILKY WAY</u></h4>
            <p>
                There are about three trillion trees on Planet Earth, and between 100-400 billion stars, approximately, in the galaxy. 
            </p>
            <h4><u>6. THE SUNSET ON MARS APPEARS BLUE</u></h4>
            <p>
                Just as colors are made more dramatic in sunsets on Earth, sunsets on Mars, according to NASA,  
                would appear bluish to human observers watching from the red planet. Fine dust makes the blue near the Sun's 
                part of the sky much more visibilke, while normal daylight makes the Red Planet's familiar rusty dust color the 
                most perceptible to the human eye. 
            </p>
            <h4><u>7. THERE ARE MORE STARS IN THE UNIVERSE THAN GRAINS OF SANDS ON EARTH</u></h4>
            <p>
                The universe extends far beyond our own galaxy, The Milky Way, which is why scientists can only estimate how many stars 
                are in space.  However, scientists estimate the universe contains approximately 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, 
                or a septillion.   While no one can actually count every single grain of sand on the earth, the estimated total from 
                researchers at the University of Hawaii, is somewhere around seven quintillion, five hundred quadrillion grains.  
                That is an awfully big sand castle!
            </p>
            <h4><u>8. THERE IS A PLANET MADE OF DIAMONDS</u></h4>
            <p>
                There’s a planet made of diamonds twice the size of earth The "super earth," aka 55 Cancri e, 
                is most likely covered in graphite and diamond.  Paying a visit to that planet would probably pay for 
                the $12 million dollar space suit needed to get there!
