<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:150%'>How do the readings relate to the ideas and ideals of the
internet (and/or WWW)?</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>According to Borge in, <i><u>The Library of Babel</u></i>, a
specific library is described as �infinite�, where it contains every book to
ever exist, although the library is infinite and not the books. The books are
meant to have meaning, regardless if it is another language, and much like the
library, in this case, every page on the internet has some type of meaning,
regardless if it is important or not. Borge explains that the library was
expected to solve every problem in the universe, it did not, and the books are
very random with different letter combinations, making each book unique. The
library can be compared to an algorithm, an algorithm can be defined as rules
that are used for problem-solving. The internet is very much similar to this
with its algorithms and how it has its own problem-solving techniques. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>Borge states that there are no two identical books in this
library as they are all unique, with the random information that they contain. The
internet is also a vast place of knowledge and contains almost everything,
likewise to the library, it has unique pages that can be identified through a
page�s URL. This is known as a Uniform Resource Locator, it is a distinctive
sentence that is used as a web page�s address, there are no URLs that are the
same. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>The books in the library are very random, they consist of all
the letters in a randomized way, which makes it quite hard to interpret or find
a meaning in it. The internet is almost the same, where random data is produced
when something is being searched for, yet it is processed and results in
outcomes that can actually be understood by people, returning their searches in
a sensible way. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>The Garden of Forking Paths</span></u></i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>, also written by Borges, has a more
detailed, underlying meaning, which does compare to certain aspects of the
internet. The story does present a concept of time, considering how Yu Tsun had
ended up in the exact same labyrinth that his forefather had created. The way
the events had played out was proof that a certain event can happen in a multiple
amount of times and have quite different outcomes. The labyrinth and book that
was created by Ts�ui Pen were actually linked in a way that made sense
together, where the paths are the same, different outcomes can occur. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>Just like this story, a quality of the internet does make its
first appearance, the Hypertext, this is a way where a set of items can link to
each other. In the case of the internet, a hypertext is a link to another
website or web page that is very much similar to your original search. The time
aspect in the story explains that time and events have certain pathways that
split and come together, and can possibly be parallel to each other, very much
like the hypertext. These can be never ending as well, considering the internet
is almost infinite too, links can be cycles that lead you to different
�pathways�, resulting in different outcomes. </span></p>
