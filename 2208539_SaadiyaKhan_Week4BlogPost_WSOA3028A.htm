reflection to Medium Is The Message</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'>The
Medium Is The Message ï¿½ Marshall McLuhan </span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>Marshall McLuhan discusses how the medium is the message, when
discussing in relation to how social and personal consequences of a medium, it
is basically an extension of our own selves. There are advances with technology
and automation, these can be seen as creating patterns that replace humans at
certain jobs, eliminating them for humans, although he describes this as a
negative result of automation. Although, the positive result of automation, as
McLuhan describes, it can also create roles for people and aid them in the jobs
that they do, making their lives simpler but without replacing them. The
message, in this case, can be seen as what a person has done with a machine and
how they had changed it, rather than it entirely being the automation and actions
of the machine. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>McLuhan describes that what makes up one medium is another
medium, and that is what the characteristic of all media is. He also uses the
analogy of a train and its movement and transportation, and how it had an impact
on human society, considering how it created new work, leisure and how it
created new cities. He then mentions how the airplane had began to make the
railways a bit more obsolete because it had accelerated the mode of transportation.
All of this is derived through example with his description of the electric
light and it connection, it is a medium with no message and it is just information.
McLuhan describes many authors and how their work had been developed in a way,
that shows that the medium is a message. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>Basically, McLuhan describes that the message is a pattern
that is created by new inventions that change the way that humans live their
lives. It is a description of communication and how machines can do things that
as humans, our bodies are not capable of. He is trying to explain that the way
we explain, communicate and how we have conversations, that mode is more
important than the actual information that is being communicated and what is rather
being said, also how the way the medium had changed the way that humans behave.
The way that McLuhan uses the light bulb as an example in comparison to media,
it shows that messages are communicated and transferred through media, although
something that is electronic, as simple as a bulb, it cannot communicate any
messages, although it does have very simplistic information. </span></p>
