            <h2>Blog Post 13: Reflection on the representation and communication strategies you used in my Data-Driven Artwork</h2>

            <p>
                Instead of discussing the reason for the interactivity of the bar graphs, I will be discussing the graph as its data visualization through art. “Information is Beautiful” 
                is a good website to draw inspiration from when it comes to using art to represent and visualize data. <br>
                <br>
                My graphs are not styled in the way that I would have liked to because my API data is giving me problems to manipulate the graph directly. Originally, I would have liked 
                to make the graph interactive by highlighting the bars when a user hovers over them, in this way it can be slightly easier to read specific data values. <br>
                <br> 
                Instead, I used checkboxes for users to interact with the data. The colors would have been more aesthetic, I could have tied it in to my space theme with shades of purple 
                and blue. This would have been a fun way to experiment with the look of my graph, as well as test the effectiveness of data visualization when using colors to manipulate the
                graphs. Both checkboxes and color manipulation can be effective ways when interacting with data. <br>
                <br>
                The representation of data would be the same because the form of manipulating the graph’s data would not change, although the way in which the data is being represented would
                change. <br>
                <br>
                Wattenberg and Viégas mention that, “A more radical change in attitude would be to embrace the fact that visualizations can be used to persuade as well as analyse.” 
                (Wattenberg, 2007, p. 10). Here we can see that having a form of artistic visualization can help in understanding and analysing the data, as well as persuasion. 
                This entails trying to convince people about the data values and how it is accurate, how it can be modified or even to use the values as a form of reference to prove something.
                he authors mention that having specific types of artistic data visualizations can also change the attitude that people have towards certain things, this can also mean improvement
                on the way that data is communicated.<br>
                <br> 
                In conclusion, artistic data can help people improve on data visualization, as well as find easier ways to communicate with audiences, instead of just for aesthetic purposes.
