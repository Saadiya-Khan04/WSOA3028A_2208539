<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:150%'>A reflection on one of the historical articles provided</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>The world wide web ï¿½ Tim Berners-Lee </span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>The article by Tim Berners-Lee et al, explains the basic
history of the internet (The World Wide Web) and its components, with how they
work together. In the article, it is mentioned how the World Wide Web was
initially developed to allow people from all over the world to collaborate on
projects together, the example given was for physicists to collaborate with
each other to build components for better physics research. Hypertext was used
in a more personal way to follow the information that had been shared,
therefore allowing the idea of the web to come about. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>There are ways that make the World Wide Web easier to use
between many collaborators, such as: Different ways to share data, easier ways
to add the data onto the web, and even having the same user interface
(therefore making it easier for users to share information and not have to
learn the different interfaces). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>The WWW can be split up into its different components, which
make it up as a whole, working system. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used
for communication through the WWW, which has been improved significantly to
HTML +. It also consists of URIs (Universal Resource Identifiers), these are
address systems of objects. There is also the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer
Protocol) which allows the transfer of information through the WWW, as well as
recovering documents. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>It is mentioned in the article that there are also other
systems that are much like the World Wide Web, such as the WAIS and Gopher have
the same capabilities and client server to the WWW. The WAIS protocol has no tools
for navigation, therefore not guiding a user through data and resources, it
also does have a text-based search and recovery. Gopher is a web that contains
loops, it also has a text-based search much like WAIS, although mainly uses
menus. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>The Gopher model and the WWW are very similar, although the
WWW model has a more efficient way of communicating options in hypertext. The
difference between the WAIS and the WWW is that the WAIS requires graphics and
text to be associated with each other, while the WWW and Gopher include sound,
video and graphics. World Wide Web users can also have access to different
servers as an interface. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>The article also contains developments to the World Wide Web,
such as software upgrades that are chosen by users and why they need in
specific software. It was also discovered that the availability of browsers and
the quality of the information have a direct impact on each other. Information
providers are also important in the sense where certain information is readily
available at particular places. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%'>There is always room for improvement in the WWW, where it can
also be a display for information technology development. The article lists a
number of web developments, such as: using the internet for profit services,
easier servers for individuals to publish information, and having specific
names for documents and not only their location pathways. </span></p>
